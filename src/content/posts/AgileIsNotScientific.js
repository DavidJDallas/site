    <h3> Introduction </h3>

    Dave Farley is, by any account, an incredibly accomplished and skilled Software 

    <h3> The Mischaracterisation of Science </h3>

    <h3> Software 'Engineering' Can Only Partially Have Scientific Foundations </h3>

     'Software engineering is the application of an empiricial, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software' 
     
    <h3> On 'Scientific Reasoning', and why Engineering does not use Scientific Reasonig </h3>

     'I describe a practical approach to software development that applies a consciously rational, scientific style of thinking to solving problems. These ideas stem from consistently applying what we have learned about software development over the last few decades'. (xxi)

     'Engineering is about adopting a scientific, rationalist approach to solving practical problems within economic constraints, but that doesn't mean that such an approach is either theoretical or bureaucratic. Almost by definition, engineering is pragmatic'. (xxii)

    <h3> Why this is Fine: On the Richness of Non-Scientific Reasoning </h3>


    'I describe a practical approach to software development that applies a consciously rational, scientific style of thinking to solving problems. These ideas stem from consistently applying what we have learned about software development over the last few decades'. (xxi)

    'This approach assembles a collection of important foundational ideas and builds on the work that went before. At one level there is nothing that is new here in terms of novel practices, but the approach that I describe assembles important ideas and practices into a coherent whole and gives us principles on which a software engineering discipline may be built'.

    

    'Software engineering is not production engineering in any form; that is not our problem. If when I say engineering it makes you think bureaucracy, please read this book and think again' (ibid).

   

    His Part 1: 'What is Software Engineering' is where I will be criticising. This forms the foundations of the book .In his own words, it 'begins by looking at what engineering really means in the context of software. This is about the principles and philosophy of engineering and how we can apply these ideas to software. This is a technical philosophy for software development'. 
    

    'Humanity's best approach to learning is science, so we need to adopt the techniques and strategies of science and apply them to our problems'. (p3)

    (1) Humanity's best approach to learning is science is incredibly contentious. Here are just 5 counter-examples to this.



    (2) What, exactly, the 'techniques' and 'strategies' of a body called science is highly problematic and contentious, in and of itself. Even more difficult is applying something like that to a discipline. 

    The reality of the situation is that Farley entirely ignores (1). It's a presupossition and treated as a given, with no justification. The same goes for (2). The scientifc method that he describes below is almost comically naieve. This is something like the Baconian method of science, developed in the late 1500s/early 1600s by Francis Bacon at the very advent of the Scientific Revolution. It has been torn apart time and time again ever since, to the point where to assert this almost feels like a joke to anyone who has done even a single module in philosophy of science. 

    A cursory history of the critiques of this method include:
    1748 - Hume's Problem of Induction
    Early 1900s: The Duhem-Quine thesis
    1930s-1940s: Popper's Critique of Inductivism
    1962: Kuhn's Paradigm Shifts
    1970s: Feyarabend's Methodological Anarchism
    1980s: The Bayesian work done on Scientific Confirmation: John EArmans' sophisticated mathematical frameworks for undestanding the relationship between evidence and how it supports theories.

    1990s: Mayo's error-statistical philosophy.
    1990s-now : The stats wars - how do humans learn about the world despite threats of error due to incomplete data?


    'The scientific method that most of us learned about in school is described by Wikipedia as 

    - Characterize: Make an observation of the current state.
    - Hypothesize: Create a description, a theory that may explain your observation.
    - Predict: Make a prediction based on your hypothesis.
    - Experiment: Test your prediction.' (p3)

    I'd like to showcase 10, extremely high-profile, non-pedantic cases in science that in no way conform to Farley's characterisation of the scientific method, nor science:

    (1) Darwin's theory of evolution. Developed through theoretical synthesis, not measurement. Key insight ws theoretical.

    (2) Einstein's theory of both Special and General Relativity (1905, 1915). Both developed through pure theoretical reasoning and thought experiments. Math came first, and experimental confirmation came years later. (1917, I think)

    (3) Plate techtonics theory (1960s): Wegener's contintental drift initially rejected despite geological evidence. Acceptance came through theoretical breakthroughts in seafloor spreading. 

    (4) DNA Double Helix Discvoer (1953): Watson and Crick succeeded through model-building and theoretical insight, not systematic measurement. 

    (5) The discvoery and development of Quantum Mechanics. (1900s-1930s). Planck, Heisenberg, Born, Schrodinger, etc, developed quantum mechanics through mathematical innovation and theoretical leaps that defied common sense. 

    (6) Discovery of Benzene structure (1865) Kekule reportedly discovered the benzene ring structure in a dream about a snake eating its own tail. 

    (7) NEwton's laws of motion in the Principia (1687).

    (8) Mendel's Laws of Inheritance (1866): Theoretical breakthroughs.
    
    In fact, I really can't think of any instances in the history of science that follow the method that Farley points out. Some contenders that come to mind are:

    - Kepler's planetary laws
    - Boyle's gas laws
    - Ohm's Law
    - Mendeleve's periodic table

    ButKepler wasn't just measuring more precisely - he made the creative leap to abandon circular orbits for ellipses, which was theoretically radical.
Boyle was guided by mechanical philosophy and corpuscular theory - the measurements were theory-laden from the start.
Ohm faced initial resistance because his mathematical approach challenged prevailing theories about electrical action.
Mendeleev made bold theoretical predictions about missing elements and corrected supposedly "precise" atomic weights based on his theoretical framework.

    p4: 'This book is deeply grounded in a practical, pragmatic approach to solving problems in software, based on an informal adoption of basic scientific principles, in other words, engineering!'. 

    Fives techniques that form the roots of the focus:
    - iteration
    -feedback
    -incrementalism
    - Experimentation
    - Empiricism

    6: 'That is the fundamental idea at the heart of this book, and its aim is to describe an intellectually consistent model that pulls together some foundational principles that sits at the roots of all great software development'.

    Science is 'an approach that allows us the intellectual freedom to challenge and refute dogma and to differentiate between fashion, plain-old bad ideas and great ones, whatever their source. It allows us to replace the bad ideas with better ideas and to improve on the good ideas. Fundamentally, we need some structure that allows us to grow and to evolve improved approaches, strategies, processes, technologies, and solutions. We call this good example science!'. 

    'This book is about what it means to apply scientific-style reasoning to our discipline and so achieve something that we can genuinely and acurrately refer to as software engineering'. 

    There is also a fundamental tension in Farley's work, for a few pages later he discusses Kuhn's idea of paradigm shfits. This is a poor reading of Kuhn. The great irony here is that Kuhn argues exactly that there is no universal scientific method, and that what counts as scineitific is entirely dependent on a particular paradigm

    Baconian Farley: "Here's THE scientific method that works across all domains and times"
Kuhnian analysis: "There is no universal scientific method - what counts as proper method changes with paradigms"
Baconian Farley: "Science progresses through better measurement and precision"
Kuhnian analysis: "Science progresses through revolutionary breaks that discard previous frameworks entirely"
Baconian Farley: "We can apply scientific techniques rationally to any problem"
Kuhnian analysis: "Scientific approaches are embedded in particular paradigms and can't be abstracted from their contexts"

    9: Argues that paradigm shifts 'give us an approach to learning more effectively and discarding bad ideas more efficiently'. 

    Chapter 2: What Is engineering

    11: Confusion between production engineering and design engineering.

    17: 'Engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems'. 

    Using 'empirical' means to learn and advance understanding and solutions towards the resolution of a problem;. 

    'for this book, when I talk about engineering, unless I qualify it specifically, I mean everything that it takes to make software. Process, tools, culture - all are part of the whole'. 


    Empiricism chapter

    To be fair, I actually think his definition, taken from Wikipedia, is a relatively ok definition.

    There are many wild things in here.But:

    82: 'our production systems will always surprise us, and they should! Ideally they will not surprise us too often in very bad ways, but any software system is really only the best guess so far of its developers. When we publish our software into production, this is, or should be, an opportunity to learn'. 

    Pages 83-84. Example of rational, solid thinking conflated with scientific reasoning. 

    What scientific reasoning actually involves:

Systematic methodology designed to control variables and eliminate bias
Attempts to discover generalizable principles or laws
Reproducible experiments that others can replicate
Statistical analysis of data across multiple cases
Peer review and community validation
Building theories that make novel predictions

What Farley describes:

A single incident of debugging
Ad hoc hypothesis formation ("maybe it's the messaging")
No controls, no systematic methodology
No attempt to generalize beyond this specific case
No quantitative analysis
Just rational troubleshooting

This is basic rational problem-solving - the kind any competent professional does. A plumber diagnosing a leak, a doctor diagnosing symptoms, a mechanic finding engine problems all use similar reasoning patterns. We don't call them scientists.
The philosophical point: Farley is committing a category error by conflating rational inquiry (which includes scientific reasoning as a subset) with scientific reasoning specifically. Science is a particular, highly disciplined form of rational inquiry with specific methodological requirements.

The problem here is that even if Farley's claim was correct - that Software Engineering is Engineering - it is a highly contentious claim that engineering, in any form, is a form of scientific reasoning. 


    92: There is an irony here (recognised by Farley) of using a quote from Feynman (an authority) to decry trusting authority. But, aside from this, the quotes that are used by Feynman are quite misleading as to what science actually is or does. 

    This decrying of authority is sort of true. But, again, misleading. A better principle in rational thinking is that we should defer expert opinion to the experts. See van Fraassen's work here.
