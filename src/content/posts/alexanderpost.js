        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p>
        Christopher Alexander's 'Notes on the Synthesis of Form' (henceforth <i> Notes </i>) occupies a curious position in software architecture. But this comes with a very important caveat, leading to it holding something of an unusual position in the foundations of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
        First, it is undoubtedly the less influential of Alexander's works. His later work - <i> A Pattern Language </i> - is absolutely the more influential text in software design and software architecture. This is where most people have come across Alexander's influence. <i> A Pattern Language </i> is mentioned explicitly and extensively in <i>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software' </i>, in <i> Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of Patterns</i>, and by Martin Fowler across talks and in his book <i> Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture </i>.
        
        Indeed, aside from Gabriel's <i> Patterns of Software: Tales from the Software Community </i>, I can't see any explicit references to <i> Notes </i> in software literature (although I'd be very grateful to be corrected on this).
        </p>
        <p>
        So, why do I claim the essentialy unreferenced text to be an important foundational text in software architecture? And why am I focusing on this text as the first text in this series of summaries of foundational texts? Because to really understand <i> A Pattern Language </i>, <i> Notes </i> is essential reading. One may definitely get solid practical advice from <i> A Pattern Language </i> without reading anything else by Alexander; but to really grasp his philosophy and reasoning behind why he says what he says, <i> Notes </i> absolutely needs to be understood.
        <br>
        This is perhaps also slightly ideologically driven: I am heavily interested in the philosophy and foundations of all things software. That is reflected in this series of summaries, and I think choosing this text of Alexander's sets the tone: we need to be able to understand the <i> why </i> of things. 
        </p>

        <p>
        We can summarise <i> Notes </i> as a manifesto for how to do good architectural design. It is comprised of three main parts: (1) Laying out what he means by 'Goodness of fit', (2) Laying out two historical paradigms in the methodology of architectural design (self-conscious vs unself-conscious), and (3) a positive manifesto of how to do design well for the unself-conscious paradigm. Part (3) forms the longest part, unsurprisingly.
        <br>
        This blog post's structure will follow these parts.
