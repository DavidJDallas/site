    Claims

    - Dave Farley's characterisation of science is not up to scratch and is very naieve.
    - However, this shouldn't take away from his valuable claims in his book on Modern Software Engineering. I am not in a place to assess whether his work here is valuable - I assume that he is, since he has been successful in the industry for many years, and the reviews of his books by trusted professionals are all very positive, citing it for good advice.
    - But nonetheless, the foundations are not currently there with how he understands science. 
    - Further, much of what he wants to do - give software 'engineering' a solid foundation in science and thus root it as a solid, undisputed 'engineering' discipline - is simply not possible. Much of software engineering can be seen as engineering - performance based on scientific concepts that utilise how CPUs work, scientifically. Writing code that you can calculate how fast it will run, even in theory, is able to be put on scientific foundations.

    But CI/CD, architectural choices, design patterns - this is not engineering, as it cannot be put on scientific foundations. Use analogy of business management - it can certainly be evidence based, and solid, sound advice. But it is not based on science, no matter how one can possibly define science. 

    (1) Farley mischaracterises what science is.
    (2) This should not take away any value of what he recommends or does. To this extent - we must argue against his point that science is the ultimate form of learning in history. 
    (3) It is only possible to partially give software 'engineering' scientific foundations. Much of it, especially the more process-based, dev-ops, stuff, simply cannot ever be given a scientific foundation. 


    'I describe a practical approach to software development that applies a consciously rational, scientific style of thinking to solving problems. These ideas stem from consistently applying what we have learned about software development over the last few decades'.

    'This approach assembles a collection of important foundational ideas and builds on the work that went before. At one level there is nothing that is new here in terms of novel practices, but the approach that I describe assembles important ideas and practices into a coherent whole and gives us principles on which a software engineering discipline may be built'.

    'Engineering is about adopting a scientific, rationalist approach to solving practical problems within economic constraints, but that doesn't mean that such an approach is either theoretical or bureaucratic. Almost by definition, engineering is pragmatic'.

    'Software engineering is the application of an empiricial, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems in software' 

    His Part 1: 'What is Software Engineering' is where I will be criticising. This forms the foundations of the book .In his own words, it 'begins by looking at what engineering really means in the context of software. This is about the principles and philosophy of engineering and how we can apply these ideas to software. This is a technical philosophy for software development'. 
    

    'Humanity's best approach to learning is science, so we need to adopt the techniques and strategies of science and apply them to our problems'.

    (1) Humanity's best approach to learning is science is incredibly contentious. Here are just 5 counter-examples to this.
    (2) What, exactly, the 'techniques' and 'strategies' of a body called science is highly problematic and contentious, in and of itself. Even more difficult is applying something like that to a discipline. 

    The reality of the situation is that Farley entirely ignores (1). It's a presupossition and treated as a given, with no justification. The same goes for (2). The scientifc method that he describes below is almost comically naieve. This is something like the Baconian method of science, developed in the late 1500s/early 1600s by Francis Bacon at the very advent of the Scientific Revolution. It has been torn apart time and time again ever since, to the point where to assert this almost feels like a joke to anyone who has done even a single module in philosophy of science. 

    A cursory history of the critiques of this method include:
    1748 - Hume's Problem of Induction
    Early 1900s: The Duhem-Quine thesis
    1930s-1940s: Popper's Critique of Inductivism
    1962: Kuhn's Paradigm Shifts
    1970s: Feyarabend's Methodological Anarchism
    1980s: The Bayesian work done on Scientific Confirmation: John EArmans' sophisticated mathematical frameworks for undestanding the relationship between evidence and how it supports theories.

    1990s: Mayo's error-statistical philosophy.
    1990s-now : The stats wars - how do humans learn about the world despite threats of error due to incomplete data?


    'The scientific method that most of us learned about in school is described by Wikipedia as 

    - Characterize: Make an observation of the current state.
    - Hypothesize: Create a description, a theory that may explain your observation.
    - Predict: Make a prediction based on your hypothesis.
    - Experiment: Test your prediction.

    I'd like to showcase 10, extremely high-profile, non-pedantic cases in science that in no way conform to Farley's characterisation of the scientific method, nor science:

    (1) Darwin's theory of evolution. Developed through theoretical synthesis, not measurement. Key insight ws theoretical.

    (2) Einstein's theory of both Special and General Relativity (1905, 1915). Both developed through pure theoretical reasoning and thought experiments. Math came first, and experimental confirmation came years later. (1917, I think)

    (3) Plate techtonics theory (1960s): Wegener's contintental drift initially rejected despite geological evidence. Acceptance came through theoretical breakthroughts in seafloor spreading. 

    (4) DNA Double Helix Discvoer (1953): Watson and Crick succeeded through model-building and theoretical insight, not systematic measurement. 

    (5) The discvoery and development of Quantum Mechanics. (1900s-1930s). Planck, Heisenberg, Born, Schrodinger, etc, developed quantum mechanics through mathematical innovation and theoretical leaps that defied common sense. 

    (6) Discovery of Benzene structure (1865) Kekule reportedly discovered the benzene ring structure in a dream about a snake eating its own tail. 

    (7) NEwton's laws of motion in the Principia (1687).

    (8) Mendel's Laws of Inheritance (1866): Theoretical breakthroughs.
    
    In fact, I really can't think of any instances in the history of science that follow the method that Farley points out. Some contenders that come to mind are:

    - Kepler's planetary laws
    - Boyle's gas laws
    - Ohm's Law
    - Mendeleve's periodic table

    ButKepler wasn't just measuring more precisely - he made the creative leap to abandon circular orbits for ellipses, which was theoretically radical.
Boyle was guided by mechanical philosophy and corpuscular theory - the measurements were theory-laden from the start.
Ohm faced initial resistance because his mathematical approach challenged prevailing theories about electrical action.
Mendeleev made bold theoretical predictions about missing elements and corrected supposedly "precise" atomic weights based on his theoretical framework.


    There is also a fundamental tension in Farley's work, for a few pages later he discusses Kuhn's idea of paradigm shfits. This is a poor reading of Kuhn. The great irony here is that Kuhn argues exactly that there is no universal scientific method, and that what counts as scineitific is entirely dependent on a particular paradigm

    Baconian Farley: "Here's THE scientific method that works across all domains and times"
Kuhnian analysis: "There is no universal scientific method - what counts as proper method changes with paradigms"
Baconian Farley: "Science progresses through better measurement and precision"
Kuhnian analysis: "Science progresses through revolutionary breaks that discard previous frameworks entirely"
Baconian Farley: "We can apply scientific techniques rationally to any problem"
Kuhnian analysis: "Scientific approaches are embedded in particular paradigms and can't be abstracted from their contexts"
